# Solar-System-calculates
This project is a Solar Photovoltaic (PV) System Design and Cost Analysis Application built in Python using Tkinter for the graphical user interface. It enables users—such as homeowners, engineers, energy consultants, and students—to design an off-grid or hybrid solar power system based on their energy needs and local environmental conditions.
